## Starting Point

Our system works with an Arduino NANO BLE 33 Sense board, which is connected to
an LPWAN transmitter from sigfox which allows a wireless transmission at low energy cost.

## Prerequisites

This system allows an online visualization in 'real time' (a weave sent every 10min)
on different platforms (for the moment Ubidots Stems _https://ubidots.com/stem/_ and in the future on Beep _https://beep.nl_)

## Installation & update

No installation required, 
to load a new code on the arduino board, you have to unscrew the box, connect the board to the software
